# Hackathon on Water Scarcity 2025 - Baseline Model Repository

This repository provides a simple toolkit to train baseline models and generate submission files for the [Hackathon on Water Scarcity 2025](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/4335). The baseline models predict water discharge for the 52 stations of eval dataset. You are free to experiment with different modeling approaches or use distinct models per station, as long as your submission file adheres to the required format (see Codabench guidelines).

## Data

- **Download:**  
  Obtain the dataset from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14826458).  
- **Setup:**  
  Unzip the dataset and place it in the root directory of the repository.
