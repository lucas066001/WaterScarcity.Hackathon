class SpatioTemporalSplit(BaseCrossValidator):
    """
    A custom cross-validator that splits the data along two dimensions:
      - Temporal: a cutoff date is determined so that training data includes 
        only observations with dates before that cutoff.
      - Spatial: the unique stations are randomly split so that training data 
        includes only a fraction (e.g. 75%) of the stations 
        while the remaining stations appear in test.

    Parameters:
      n_splits: number of folds.
      date_col: column name for the observation date.
      station_col: column name for the station code.
      temporal_frac: fraction (between 0 and 1) of the timeline 
      to use for training.
      The cutoff date is chosen as the quantile of the unique dates.
      spatial_frac: fraction (between 0 and 1) of stations 
      to include in training.
      random_state: random seed for reproducibility.
